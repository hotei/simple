## OVERVIEW

This project is a collection of simple go programs.  Each one
should compile and run with Go 1.  If you're still using r60.3 or earlier 
then it might or
might not work without conversion.  They were useful to me when learning go and
I still look at them when I need to refresh my memory on how certain things work.  If you
have go installed they should build without problems.  If you don't then
they can still be copied into the go "playground" at golang.org for experimentation.

The programs in alphabetic order:

* after
* env
* goroutine
* treewalk


### Installation

Since there are multiple subdirectories the easiest installation is 

> ```cd DestinationDirectory```

> ```git clone https://github.com/hotei/simple.git```

* The typing has already been done :-)
